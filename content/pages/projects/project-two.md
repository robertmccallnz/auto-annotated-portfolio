  People Like Us Systems Orchestra is a rather ambitious project to create
  Autonomous AI Agents which feel and act like humans, with crypto wallets,
  ambitions, goals, needs and varying levels of intelligence. All housed within
  a DAO or decentralised autonomous organisation governed by it's users (real
  people) who create the agents to work for them.
